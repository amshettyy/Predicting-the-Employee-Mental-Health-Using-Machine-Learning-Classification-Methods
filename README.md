Predicting the Employee Mental Health Using Machine Learning Classification Methods
Abstract
Employee mental health is an important part of workplace well-being since it affects productivity, job satisfaction, and overall organisational effectiveness. This study investigates the use of the several machine learning classification approach to predict employee mental health based on numerous workplace environment characteristics. The process entails gathering information on employees' mental health, demographics, work-related characteristics, and stress levels. To handle missing data and maintain data consistency, preprocessing techniques are used. The most influential variables influencing mental health are identified through feature selection. The selected characteristics are then used to train a machine learning models on a split dataset of training and testing samples. Future research could look into more sophisticated machine learning methods, feature engineering techniques, and model interpretability. Integrating possible mental health data with other relevant sources, as well as resolving ethical concerns, are critical for responsible and effective application in real-world employment contexts. Predictive models for employee mental health have the ability to enable organisations to support their employees' well-being proactively, build better work environments, and have a beneficial impact on overall productivity and employee happiness.
